If you want to follow me, I'll take you to your seats and I'll stand beside you the whole time.\nLine 1070: Travis: Fucking lead the way.\nLine 1071: Taliesin: Hey, Jester. Before you go. Tiefling to tiefling, and thank you for keeping this rabble in check.\nLine 1072: Laura: Of course, you know, they're a lot to handle.\nLine 1073: Taliesin: One on the house.

Oh boy.\nLine 1178: Matt: All right, so. 20 to 15?\nLine 1179: Laura: 21.\nLine 1180: Matt: All right.\nLine 1181: Laura: Oh, wait, 22.\nLine 1182: Matt: Nice. 15 to ten?\nLine 1183: Taliesin: Ten.\nLine 1184: Sam: Ten.\nLine 1185: Travis: 12.\nLine 1186: Ashley: 13.\nLine 1187: Liam: 11.\nLine 1188: Matt: So 13 and then ten and ten? Sorry, 12. So Yasha got 13, then we have Fjord. And then 11. And then we have Nott at ten. And what'd you get?\nLine 1189: Marisha: Five. Rolled terribly.\nLine 1190: Matt: There we go. Okay, so. Top of the round, as this creature turns and glares about in the area, this swollen form over here to the side, that's wh\nLine 1191: Laura: Okay. Well, I'm just going to go for it, all right? I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt on the monster that just appeared.\nLine 1192: Matt: Okay, as it turns towards you. It's a saving throw, correct?\nLine 1193: Laura: Let's find out. You make a ranged spell attack.\nLine 1194: Matt: Go ahead and roll on that.\n\n=== Around line 1225 (combat) ===\nLine 1220: Ashley: Okay. I'll pass my weapons out this turn.\nLine 1221: Matt: Okay, so you'll spend your action throwing them out to the individuals. So your shortsword and crossbow clatter to the ground, and you quickly s\nLine 1222: Sam: Falchion.\nLine 1223: Marisha: Falchion.\nLine 1224: Matt: All right. That ends Yasha's turn. Fjord, you're up.\nLine 1225: Travis: Can I run up with the falchion within melee?\nLine 1226: Matt: You actually rush through Jester's form. You watch the image dissipate as you charge through it and meet up, face-to-face, with this large, gnar\nLine 1227: Travis: Ripping the falchion, can I swing it into the creature?\nLine 1228: Matt: You may.\nLine 1229: Laura: And you get advantage.\nLine 1230: Travis: I do? Thank god, because that was a one. 18.\nLine 1231: Matt: 18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.\nLine 1232: Travis: Nice.\nLine 1233: Sam: It's a real fight!\nLine 1234: Matt: Yeah.\nLine 1235: Travis: 11.\nLine 1236: Sam: We've got like a dozen hit points, we'll be okay.\nLine 1237: Matt: All righty. That ends your turn? All right, you're done. That brings us to Caleb.\nLine 1238: Liam: I would like to use my movement to push as far into the crowd as I can.\nLine 1239: Matt: Okay, going through the crowd is--\nLine 1240: Liam: Half-movement? That's fine, sure. I just want people in front of me.\nLine 1241: Matt: Push through to about there. You end up pushing a kid out of the way.\nLine 1242: Liam: That's great. That's exactly fine with me and I will pull out the diamond and cast Chromatic Orb, and I will send a ball of cold at the creature\nLine 1243: Matt: All right, go ahead and make a spell attack.\nLine 1244: Liam: Yes, here it comes.\nLine 1245: Sam: Watch out for Fee-ord. (laughter)\nLine 1246: Liam: My goodness. That is a 17.\nLine 1247: Matt: 17 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.\nLine 1248: Laura: Isn't Chromatic Orb like a really strong spell?\nLine 1249: Liam: No.\nLine 1250: Matt: There's Prismatic Spray. Chromatic is the starter version.\nLine 1251: Liam: That is nine.\nLine 1252: All: Nein!\nLine 1253: Matt: (German accent) All right, very well done, Caleb.\nLine 1254: Liam: (thicker German accent) Now is the part where we dance.\nLine 1255: Matt: So as you push the child out of the way, turn, putting your pocketed diamond out in front of you, you focus and you watch as this beam of light \nLine 1256: Sam: Okay. Having seen the beautiful dwarven-- girl, was it? Who sang and soothed a monster earlier in the show, I'm going to attempt to sing and soot\nLine 1257: Laura: Can I shoot an arrow at Nott?\nLine 1258: Liam: He's killing the memory of Scanlan.\nLine 1259: Marisha: I know, can't let that go.\n\n=== Around line 1340 (combat) ===\nLine 1335: Matt: Cool. Is that your turn? All right. The standing creature that's now been sliced, bludgeoned, and wounded by all three of you, is going to go ah\nLine 1336: Marisha: My armor class is 17.\nLine 1337: Matt: Nine points of bludgeoning damage as the first one just slams you in the chest. You feel the wind knocked out of you for a brief second. The sec\nLine 1338: Marisha: Yup, yup, that hits.\nLine 1339: Travis: This thing's swinging hard. Holy shit.\nLine 1340: Matt: And that's going to be six points of bludgeoning damage to you.\nLine 1341: Liam: What are you at, girl?\nLine 1342: Marisha: Don't worry about it. I'm bad.\nLine 1343: Matt: It slams into you once with the fist, and the other one grabs into your stomach, abdomen region, and the claws dig in, and its jaw unhinges and \nLine 1344: Marisha: I turn to Fjord and I go, I'm not a claque, this show's bullshit.\nLine 1345: Matt: The other one is going to rush over towards you, Mollymauk, as you're the closest one to it, and is going to take one swing at you.\nLine 1346: Taliesin: Yeah, no. I'm going to use Blood Maladict.\nLine 1347: Matt: Okay, so you're using a reaction? You don't have to roll anything for it. He just has disadvantage on the strike.\nLine 1348: Taliesin: Oh, that's right, because I'm not doubling it up.\nLine 1349: Matt: That'll do it. He rolled a 16 and then a four. So as it swings towards you, you watch as suddenly the reddish burning eyes of the second creatur\nLine 1350: Travis: That is 16.\nLine 1351: Matt: 16 hits! Go ahead and roll damage.\nLine 1352: Travis: Nice. That is 12 points of damage.\nLine 1353: Matt: With this brief opening as it rushes past Mollymauk, after its eyes go black, you watch as it stumbles, its vision ruined. With that moment, you\nLine 1354: Sam: All right, Yasha!\nLine 1355: Ashley: Can I get to the big beast? Beast number one? Okay, so this is the first time I've done this, so hopefully I won't do this wrong. I would like\nLine 1356: Ashley: I'm going to workshop it, I'll make something later. For now, it's a placeholder. Okay, I would like to rage, and reckless attack?\nLine 1357: Matt: Yeah, you can reckless attack any of your attacks.\nLine 1358: Sam: Is that something you can do right away? That sounds like a later thing.\nLine 1359: Ashley: Is that something you do later? Okay. I didn't get a practice shot at this. Okay. So I just roll.\nLine 1360: Matt: You roll at advantage.\nLine 1361: Ashley: I don't know how to play D&D anymore! I just forgot how to do it.\nLine 1362: Laura: Okay, but roll again, you have advantage.\nLine 1363: Ashley: Oh, reckless. Okay. 17?\nLine 1364: Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.\n\n=== Around line 1380 (combat) ===\nLine 1375: Sam: Yasha!\nLine 1376: Ashley: Okay, okay, okay.\nLine 1377: Matt: Okay, that ends your turn. As you're there, growling animalistically towards the creature.\nLine 1378: Ashley: Ooh, that feels fun.\nLine 1379: Matt: You have about five more feet of movement, if you wanted to move.\nLine 1380: Ashley: Okay, so I'm going to go a little bit closer to-- wait, how many more are left? Just the other one? Yeah, so I'll get ready for the other one.\nLine 1381: Matt: All right. That ends your turn, Yasha. Fjord, you're up.\nLine 1382: Travis: Shit. I'll turn and head towards other tree-zombie fuck. I would like to use my bonus action to cast Hex on it.\nLine 1383: Matt: Okay. So you watch as Fjord lumbers towards it, his large, armored half-orc form holding the blade in his hand. Puts his hand out, and the shado\nLine 1384: Travis: I would like to use my falchion to open it the fuck up.\nLine 1385: Matt: All right, go for it.\nLine 1386: Travis: 21.\nLine 1387: Matt: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage.\nLine 1388: Travis: That's 12 points of damage, plus five points of necrotic damage.\nLine 1389: Matt: 17 points of damage.\nLine 1390: Liam: Level two, that's major.\nLine 1391: Matt: So, as you rush up, after the shadows gather around it, it looks up to you, and it pulls back, ready to strike, and you just shake your head, an\nLine 1392: Liam: All right, I know that it's restricted movement, but I will push this way through the crowd so that I have a clearer shot, as far as I can, and \nLine 1393: Matt: You can push right about there. You just barely pull through the crowd to the front to get a clear--\nLine 1394: Laura: Hi, Caleb.\nLine 1395: Liam: I certainly don't want to do that. I want to stay in the crowd, behind people, and I will do Chromatic Orb again, but this time, I'm going to se\nLine 1396: Matt: 11 unfortunately does not hit. So as you pull it out a second time, you're pushing through the crowd and you pull up your diamond, and right as \nLine 1397: Liam: Hope that didn't hit anyone.\nLine 1398: Matt: All right, that ends your turn, Caleb. Nott, you're up.\nLine 1399: Sam: Do I have eyes on the biggie? Is Fjord right next to her?\nLine 1400: Matt: Fjord and Mollymauk are both next to it, yes.\nLine 1401: Sam: All right. I'm going to peek out behind whatever patron I'm next to, take out my little crossbow and just shoot a little shot.\nLine 1402: Matt: All right, go for it.\nLine 1403: Travis: Is it made of piano wire? (laughter)\nLine 1404: Sam: 16.\nLine 1405: Matt: 16 hits.\nLine 1406: Laura: I like how every time you roll it comes out.\nLine 1407: Sam: It does. This is very bouncy. Okay, so 1d6, that's a four, plus four is eight, plus I get sneak attack damage, 'cause I'm a rogue. Another four, \nLine 1408: Sam: To inflict another two points of damage, so that's 14 points of damage.\nLine 1409: Matt: Okay.

Looking back at the combat sequence, Fjord's actual rolls are the perception check, insight check, initiative, the attack with advantage where he rolled 1 and 18, the damage of 11, the attack of 21, and the damage of 12 plus 5 necrotic.\n\nWait, I should double-check line 1350. The creature attacked Mollymauk with disadvantage and rolled 16 and 4, so the 4 would hit. But then Travis says \"That is 16\" - that seems like he's reporting his own roll, not commenting on the creature's attack. Let me trace through the turn order more carefully to see whose turn it actually is at that point.\n\nLooking at the sequence: Jester went first with Guiding Bolt, then Yasha passed out weapons, then Fjord attacked and hit for 11 damage. Caleb followed with Chromatic Orb hitting for 9 damage. Nott attempted something but I need to see what happened next to understand where this 16 fits in.\n\nThe creature then attacked multiple targets - it hit Beau for 9 damage with one slam, then hit her again for 6 damage with claws. Another creature moved toward Mollymauk and attacked, but Mollymauk used Blood Maladict to impose disadvantage. The creature rolled a 16 and a 4 with disadvantage, so the lower roll would determine the outcome.\n\nLooking at the transcript more carefully, Travis's \"That is 16\" appears to be his own attack roll, not a comment on the creature's roll. The sequence suggests Fjord is making an attack that hits for 12 damage, though the exact timing of when this occurs relative to the creature's attack on Mollymauk needs clarification from the surrounding context. The 16 that Travis calls out at line 1350 appears to be his own attack roll, not a reaction to the creature's attack. Matt's response \"16 hits! Go ahead and roll damage\" confirms this is Fjord making an attack. The timing is unclear from the transcript—Fjord may have had a reaction attack or an opportunity attack, but the sequence suggests this is his turn or an extra attack rather than a direct response to the creature's roll. I should focus on identifying all of Fjord's rolls throughout the episode rather than getting caught up in the exact timing of this particular exchange.","usage":{"prompt_tokens":12371,"completion_tokens":1236,"total_tokens":13607,"cached_tokens":8192,"reasoning_tokens":941,"cost":0.0097726}}

Let me analyze each of Travis/Fjord's rolls:\n\n1. **Line 237**: \"Natural 20\" - This is a perception check (first roll of the campaign) - **1 roll**\n\n2. **Line 777**: \"13\" - This is an insight check - **1 roll**\n\n3. **Line 1064**: \"11\" - This is a perception check - **1 roll**\n\n4. **Line 1185**: \"12\" - This is initiative - **1 roll**\n\n5. **Line 1230**: \"I do? Thank god, because that was a one. 18.\" - This is an attack roll with advantage (rolled a 1 and an 18) - **1 roll** (but actually 2 dice rolled due to advantage)\n\n6. **Line 1235**: \"11\" - This is damage roll - **1 roll**\n\n7. **Line 1350**: \"That is 16\" - This is an attack roll - **1 roll**\n\n8. **Line 1352**: \"Nice. That is 12 points of damage.\" - This is a damage roll - **1 roll**\n\n9. **Line 1386**: \"21\" - This is an attack roll - **1 roll**\n\n10. **Line 1388**: \"That's 12 points of damage, plus five points of necrotic damage.\" - This is a damage roll - **1 roll**\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. The question asks for \"rolls\" - I need to count each die roll, not each action.\n\nLet me reconsider:\n- Line 237: Natural 20 - 1 roll (perception check)\n- Line 777: 13 - 1 roll (insight check)\n- Line 1064: 11 - 1 roll (perception check)\n- Line 1185: 12 - 1 roll (initiative)\n- Line 1230: \"that was a one. 18\" - This is advantage, so 2 rolls for the attack\n- Line 1235: 11 - 1 roll (damage)\n- Line 1350: 16 - 1 roll (attack)\n- Line 1352: 12 - 1 roll (damage)\n- Line 1386: 21 - 1 roll (attack)\n- Line 1388: 12 + 5 necrotic - 1 roll for weapon damage (the 5 necrotic is from Hex, which is automatic)\n\nSo the total would be: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 rolls?\n\nWait, let me reconsider the advantage roll. When you have advantage, you roll 2 dice. So that's 2 rolls for the attack at line 1230.\n\nActually, I need to think about this more carefully. The question is \"Total number of rolls by the character Fjord in this episode?\"\n\nIn D&D, a \"roll\" typically refers to each time dice are rolled. So:\n- Perception check: 1 roll\n- Insight check: 1 roll\n- Perception check: 1 roll\n- Initiative: 1 roll\n- Attack with advantage: 2 rolls (rolled a 1 and an 18)\n- Damage: 1 roll\n- Attack: 1 roll\n- Damage: 1 roll\n- Attack: 1 roll\n- Damage: 1 roll\n\nTotal: 11 rolls\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if the Hex damage is rolled or automatic. Hex adds 1d6 necrotic damage, so that would be another roll. Let me check line 1388 again: \"That's 12 points of damage, plus five points of necrotic damage.\"\n\nThe 12 is from the falchion (1d8 + something), and the 5 is from Hex (1d6). So that's actually 2 rolls - one for weapon damage and one for Hex damage.\n\nHmm, but the question is about \"rolls\" - does each die roll count separately? Or does each \"action\" count as one roll?\n\nLet me think about this differently. In D&D:\n- When you make an attack, you roll a d20 - that's 1 roll\n- When you roll damage, you might roll multiple dice (e.g., 2d6), but that's still considered 1 \"damage roll\"\n- When you have advantage, you roll 2d20, but that's still 1 \"attack roll\" (just with 2 dice)\n\nSo the question might be asking for the number of \"roll actions\" rather than individual dice.\n\nLet me count the \"roll actions\":\n1. Perception check (line 237) - 1 roll\n2. Insight check (line 777) - 1 roll\n3. Perception check (line 1064) - 1 roll\n4. Initiative (line 1185) - 1 roll\n5. Attack roll with advantage (line 1230) - 1 roll (even though 2 dice were rolled)\n6. Damage roll (line 1235) - 1 roll\n7. Attack roll (line 1350) - 1 roll\n8. Damage roll (line 1352) - 1 roll\n9. Attack roll (line 1386) - 1 roll\n10. Damage roll (line 1388) - 1 roll (weapon) + possibly 1 roll (Hex)\n\nActually, I think the most reasonable interpretation is to count each time dice are rolled as a separate \"roll\". So:\n- Line 237: 1 roll (perception)\n- Line 777: 1 roll (insight)\n- Line 1064: 1 roll (perception)\n- Line 1185: 1 roll (initiative)\n- Line 1230: 2 rolls (attack with advantage - rolled a 1 and an 18)\n- Line 1235: 1 roll (damage)\n- Line 1350: 1 roll (attack)\n- Line 1352: 1 roll (damage)\n- Line 1386: 1 roll (attack)\n- Line 1388: 1 roll (weapon damage) + 1 roll (Hex damage) = 2 rolls\n\nTotal: 1+1+1+1+2+1+1+1+1+2 = 12 rolls\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if Hex damage is rolled separately or if it's included in the same roll. Let me check the context again.\n\nActually, looking at line 1388: \"That's 12 points of damage, plus five points of necrotic damage.\"\n\nThe 12 is likely from the falchion (1d8 + Strength modifier), and the 5 is from Hex (1d6). These are typically rolled separately - you roll weapon damage, then roll Hex damage. So that would be 2 rolls.\n\nBut I should also check if there are any other rolls I might have missed. Let me also verify the context around each roll to make sure I'm counting correctly.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the advantage roll at line 1230. The transcript says \"that was a one. 18.\" This suggests Travis rolled a 1 and then rolled an 18 (or had advantage and rolled both). In either case, 2 dice were rolled.\n\nLet me also check if there are any saving throws or other rolls I might have missed.\n\nActually, I realize I should use the LLM to help me count the rolls more accurately, since the transcript might have nuances I'm missing.","usage":{"prompt_tokens":13762,"completion_tokens":1879,"total_tokens":15641,"cached_tokens":5376,"reasoning_tokens":1389,"cost":0.015474}}

The question asks for \"rolls\" - in D&D, each die roll counts as a roll. Let me think about this more carefully:\n\n1. Perception check (nat 20) - 1 roll\n2. Insight check (13) - 1 roll\n3. Perception check (11) - 1 roll\n4. Initiative (12) - 1 roll\n5. Attack roll with advantage (rolled 1 and 18, took 18) - This is 2 rolls!\n6. Damage roll (11) - 1 roll\n7. Attack roll (16) - 1 roll (opportunity attack)\n8. Damage roll (12) - 1 roll\n9. Attack roll (21) - 1 roll\n10. Damage roll (12) - 1 roll\n\nBut wait, the Hex damage (5 necrotic) - is that rolled? Let me check. The line says \"plus five points of necrotic damage\" - this sounds like it was rolled (5 on a d6 or similar).\n\nActually, let me reconsider the advantage roll. When Travis says \"that was a one. 18.\" - he rolled two dice (advantage) and got a 1 and an 18. \n\nThat's 2 rolls for the attack. So counting all rolls:\n1. Perception (nat 20) - 1 roll\n2. Insight (13) - 1 roll\n3. Perception (11) - 1 roll\n4. Initiative (12) - 1 roll\n5. Attack with advantage (1 and 18) - 2 rolls\n6. Damage (11) - 1 roll\n7. Attack (16) - 1 roll\n8. Damage (12) - 1 roll\n9. Attack (21) - 1 roll\n10. Damage (12) - 1 roll\n11. Hex damage (5) - 1 roll\n\nThat's 12 total rolls. But I should verify whether the Hex damage was actually rolled or if it was just stated. Looking at line 1388: \"That's 12 points of damage, plus five points of necrotic damage\" - this appears to be a rolled result, so that's another roll.\n\nActually, I need to be more careful about what counts as a \"roll.\" The question asks for the total number of rolls by Fjord. In D&D, when you have advantage, you roll two dice but it's still considered one \"check\" or \"attack.\" The question might be asking about the number of dice rolled, or the number of separate roll events.\n\nLooking at the advantage roll more carefully - Travis rolled twice (1 and 18) for a single attack. If counting individual dice rolls, that's 2. If counting roll events, that's 1.\n\nThe safest interpretation is counting each separate die roll as one roll. With advantage on the attack, that's 2 dice rolled. The Hex damage also appears to be a rolled value (5 on a d6), so that's another roll.\n\nSo the total is: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12 rolls.\n\nBut I should double-check whether the Hex damage was actually rolled or just stated. The transcript shows Travis saying \"plus five points of necrotic damage\" - this could be a rolled result (5 on a d6 for Hex) or it could be a fixed value. Hex typically deals 1d6 necrotic damage, so 5 would be a rolled result.\n\nLet me verify this interpretation by checking if there are any other rolls I might have missed or miscounted.","usage":{"prompt_tokens":14537,"completion_tokens":1595,"total_tokens":16132,"cached_tokens":13760,"reasoning_tokens":853,"cost":0.008633}}

Top of the round, as this creature turns and glares about in the area, this swollen form over here to the side, that's what remains of the old man who had stood up in the \n624: \n625: --- Lines 1222-1227 ---\n626: Sam: Falchion.\n627: Marisha: Falchion.\n628: Matt: All right. That ends Yasha's turn. Fjord, you're up.\n629: Travis: Can I run up with the falchion within melee?\n630: Matt: You actually rush through Jester's form. You watch the image dissipate as you charge through it and meet up, face-to-face, with this large, gnarled, horrible-looking creature. What are you doing\n631: \n632: --- Lines 1223-1228 ---\n633: Marisha: Falchion.\n634: Matt: All right. That ends Yasha's turn.

I just want people in front of me.\n669: Matt: Push through to about there. You end up pushing a kid out of the way.\n670: Liam: That's great. That's exactly fine with me and I will pull out the diamond and cast Chromatic Orb, and I will send a ball of cold at the creature that Fee-ord-- Fjord--\n671: Matt: All right, go ahead and make a spell attack.\n672: Liam: Yes, here it comes.\n673: \n674: --- Lines 1306-1311 ---\n675: Taliesin: All right. Can I get close enough to take a shot?\n676: Matt: You can, yeah.\n677: Travis: Take a shot?\n678: Sam: You have guns?\n679: Taliesin: Well, old habit. (laughter)\n680: \n681: --- Lines 1337-1342 ---\n682: Matt: Nine points of bludgeoning damage as the first one just slams you in the chest. You feel the wind knocked out of you for a brief second. The second swing's going to come at you. That's going to \n683: Marisha: Yup, yup, that hits.\n684: Travis: This thing's swinging hard. Holy shit.\n685: Matt: And that's going to be six points of bludgeoning damage to you.\n686: Liam: What are you at, girl?\n687: \n688: --- Lines 1342-1347 ---\n689: Marisha: Don't worry about it. I'm bad.\n690: Matt: It slams into you once with the fist, and the other one grabs into your stomach, abdomen region, and the claws dig in, and its jaw unhinges and drops like a snake's.\n691: Marisha: I turn to Fjord and I go, I'm not a claque, this show's bullshit.\n692: Matt: The other one is going to rush over towards you, Mollymauk, as you're the closest one to it, and is going to take one swing at you.\n693: Taliesin: Yeah, no. I'm going to use Blood Maladict.\n694: \n695: --- Lines 1348-1353 ---\n696: Taliesin: Oh, that's right, because I'm not doubling it up.\n697: Matt: That'll do it. He rolled a 16 and then a four. So as it swings towards you, you watch as suddenly the reddish burning eyes of the second creature go black, and it goes way too wide and misses yo\n698: Travis: That is 16.\n699: Matt: 16 hits! Go ahead and roll damage.\n700: Travis: Nice. That is 12 points of damage.\n701: \n702: --- Lines 1350-1355 ---\n703: Travis: That is 16.\n704: Matt: 16 hits! Go ahead and roll damage.\n705: Travis: Nice. That is 12 points of damage.\n706: Matt: With this brief opening as it rushes past Mollymauk, after its eyes go black, you watch as it stumbles, its vision ruined. With that moment, you swing out with your-- falchion, thank you. Yeah, \n707: Sam: All right, Yasha!\n708: \n709: --- Lines 1379-1384 ---\n710: Matt: You have about five more feet of movement, if you wanted to move.\n711: Ashley: Okay, so I'm going to go a little bit closer to-- wait, how many more are left? Just the other one? Yeah, so I'll get ready for the other one. So a little bit closer to it.\n712: Matt: All right. That ends your turn, Yasha. Fjord, you're up.\n713: Travis: Shit. I'll turn and head towards other tree-zombie fuck. I would like to use my bonus action to cast Hex on it.\n714: Matt: Okay. So you watch as Fjord lumbers towards it, his large, armored half-orc form holding the blade in his hand. Puts his hand out, and the shadows suddenly swirl and gather around this zombified\n715: \n716: --- Lines 1380-1385 ---\n717: Ashley: Okay, so I'm going to go a little bit closer to-- wait, how many more are left?

I am sorry for getting in your way.\" And he stands up and gives you all a nod and rushes out of the tavern, a little embarrassed by all the attention that's now placed on him by the other patrons, and as he leaves, everyone goes back to their business, a couple of wandering eyes starting to count what coins are there as you slowly mitt them in your direction.\n\n--- Lines 231-236 ---\nMarisha: Okay, okay.\nMatt: There are four gold pieces amongst the pile, 22 silver, and 48 copper pieces.\nTravis: Can I clock the room, see who else is watching her count?\nMatt: Perception check. 48 copper.\nTravis: Is this the first roll?\n\n--- Lines 233-238 ---\nTravis: Can I clock the room, see who else is watching her count?\nMatt: Perception check. 48 copper.\nTravis: Is this the first roll?\nMatt: First roll of the campaign.\nTravis: Natural 20.

And then 22 silver, that's--\nLaura: Tell you what, you do that math.\nMatt: While you're counting this out and figuring out the division of your gains, Fjord, you glance about, narrowing your orcish eyes across the room, and you can see two other tables there are some gentlemen who are peering over, and as soon as they meet your gaze, they go right back to their business and completely shrink away. There's a man and a hooded figure at a table immediately adjacent to you. The man looks rather filthy, his hair a bit unkempt, and he's trying to finish his drink. However, the smaller halfling-looking figure is just glaring intently, and is slowly leaning in the direction of the table.\nTravis: That's creepy. Fucking disgusting. I think we have people watching us.\nLaura: Who is watching us?\n\n--- Lines 250-255 ---\nLaura: Tell you what, you d\nthe board is pretty empty at the moment.\nLiam: DM, did I tear that?

(laughter)\nLaura: No, don't say that. I don't want to see art with you with Annabelle's face.\nSam: Too late.\n\n--- Lines 794-799 ---\nMatt: The internet's running with that now.\nSam: Check your Twitter.\nTravis: It seems we have all day. What were your plans?\nLiam: Not much. We were going to sample the different Trosts, and I wanted to maybe do some book browsing. Nothing major.\nLaura: What's a Trost?\n\n--- Lines 803-808 ---\nLiam: There are two others to choose from, here.\nMarisha: They're who we loaded crates for, and then we kind of swindled their employee.\nTravis: Didn't leave on the best of terms.\nLiam: DM, which one is the one that everybody knows has got the blessing of Fryda Langer?\nMatt: No, that is actually the Baumbauch.\n\n--- Lines 816-821 ---\nLaura: You need a beer?\nSam: Well, I prefer the harder stuff, but I'll take what I can get at this point. Yeah, I'm sticking with this fucking accent for the next two years. (laughter)\nTravis: Laryngitis every Friday.

To the carnival!\nMatt: You can totally do that.\n\n--- Lines 881-886 ---\nSam: My god, Ashley's a master fiddler, isn't she?\nAshley: Beedle-deedle. (laughter)\nTravis: I love how your fiddle noises were \"beedle-deedle\".\nAshley: That's the sound for all instruments, right?\nSam: Drums.\n\n--- Lines 906-911 ---\nTaliesin: Card duty it is.\nMatt: \"All right. Folks, excited for your patronage.\" As he spins around and addresses the whole crowd now and says, \"Enjoy the night air. Walk slowly. We need just a moment to set up.\" And the half-elf man bows and tips his large-- it looks almost like a top hat that gets floppy towards the top and flops forward, and he puts it back on top and begins sauntering, continuing the music, but picking up their pace to get ahead of the crowd as they draw you all slowly towards the exterior tent. And that's where we're going to go ahead and take our break. (yelling)\nTravis: Face is on fire.\nLaura: Am I the only one going, do we really have to give up our weapons? I don't feel okay with this.\nSam: Ashley, I'll do whatever you want, but if you take my weapons I might kill you.\n\n--- Lines 918-923 ---\nMatt: I know. Welcome back. So, first and foremost, we have our winner of the white oak complete dice tower from our friends at Wyrmwood. The winner is GTDevoto. Congratulations. Denova will reach out to you and get your contact information. Everyone else, thank you for entering. We'll have more with each future episode of Critical Role, thanks to our friends at Wyrmwood Gaming. Also, as a heads-up for those who aren't familiar and for those who may be, we have a Tuesday aftershow of this called Ta\nt is 16.\nMatt: 16 hits! Go ahead and roll damage.\nTravis: Nice. That is 12 points of damage.\n\n--- Lines 1350-1355 ---\nTravis: That is 16.\nMatt: 16 hits! Go ahead and roll damage.\nTravis: Nice. That is 12 points of damage.\nMatt: With this brief opening as it rushes past Mollymauk, after its eyes go black, you watch as it stumbles, its vision ruined. With that moment, you swing out with your-- falchion, thank you. Yeah, it's falchion, that's right-- and strike across the back of its shoulder. You see what once was this beautiful young woman is now this swollen, horrible undead form lumbering past, and you cut a heavy chunk of meat off of its shoulder. It curves around and makes a second strike at you, Mollymauk. This one without advantage. That's a natural 19. Yeah, that's a 24 to hit. All right. You take eight points of bludgeoning damage, as the first one, you manage to move out of the way, and as you spin your scimitar around, you glance over just in time to have it clock you right across the jaw. Your vision blurs and doubles for a second. That's going to end their turn. Yasha, you're up.\nSam: All right, Yasha!\n\n--- Lines 1379-1384 ---\nMatt: You have about five more feet of movement, if you wanted to move.\nAshley: Okay, so I'm going to go a little bit closer to-- wait, how many more are left? Just the other one? Yeah, so I'll get ready for the other one. So a little bit closer to it.\nMatt: All right. That ends your turn, Yasha. Fjord, you're up.\nTravis: Shit. I'll turn and head towards other tree-zombie fuck. I would like to use my bonus action to cast Hex on it.\nMatt: Okay. So you watch as Fjord lumbers towards it, his large, armored half-orc form holding the blade in his hand. Puts his hand out, and the shadows suddenly swirl and gather around this zombified woman's form and cling to it, like it's holding it in place.
